# Implementation status

Moved from the README.

Implemented in 0.1.0: discovery and source hashing, OpenAI-compatible / Anthropic / Gemini adapters, a fake adapter for tests, deterministic compile of structured markdown, lock rendering, the validator, an ed25519-signed manifest, JWT and API-key auth, built-in CRUD, offset pagination (platform `max-page-size` 500), soft delete, per-row `owner-key` scoping, and a single-connection Postgres executor with schema-per-tenant RLS settings.

Deferred: platform KMS and GitHub review binding, refresh tokens, account lockout, real captcha, persisted quotas, cross-instance rate limits, crypto-shredding, the email outbox, webhooks, queues, schedules, Postgres TLS, and a connection pool per tenant. Custom method steps other than `method`, `respond`, and `validate` are not executed. Challenge proofs are accepted when the header is non-empty.
